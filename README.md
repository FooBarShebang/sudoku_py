# sudoku_py
Playground for CLI utilities and logic / combinatorics algorithms development
## Goal
This project aims for creation of a Sudoku game client, thus it can be played by a human user, as well as of the puzzle generator and solver. Not only the classic 3 x 3 puzzles are concerned, but the generic m x n fields.

The interaction with the user is planned to be implemented with CLI (console) as well as with GUI using various frameworks.
