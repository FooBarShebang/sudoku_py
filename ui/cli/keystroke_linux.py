Module sudoku_py.ui.cli.keystroke_linux

Implementation of the keystroke listener for the POSIX platforms. Do not import
on the non POSIX OSes! The main class KeyboardListenerLinux must be instantiated
and no more than a single istance of it must exist at any time. Make sure to
delete the previous instance before creating a new one. Also do no forget to
explicitely delete the last remaining instance before exiting the program.
Otherwise the console will behave strangly as well as some sdtin related
threading problems may occur.
